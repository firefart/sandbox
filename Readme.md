# Windows Sandbox Configuration

This is a simple configuration for Windows Sandbox with some basic tools installed.

For configuration options in the `.wsb` file please read [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-configure-using-wsb-file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-configure-using-wsb-file).

## Additional config

## Usage

First download all files by executing `.\downloadFiles.ps1` inside powershell. This will grab all setups needed. Then run `.\createSandboxConfig.ps1` once to create the `.wsb` file. This is needed because relative paths are currently not supported by Windows Sandbox.

Then simply doubleclick the `sandbox.wsb` file to launch the sandbox. This will install all needed software on start.
